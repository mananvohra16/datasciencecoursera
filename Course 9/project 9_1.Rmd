Problem statement

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.


Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)
```

```{r}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=77.1025, lat=28.7041, popup="India Capital")

m  # Print the map
```
